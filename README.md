__FIRST AND FOREMOST, URIDIUM IS JUST A WIP EDUCATIONAL TOOLKIT FOR LEARNING FEATURES WITHIN FIVEM__

## About

I, ArkSeyonet, created this project because I was bored, and I wanted to tinker with writing a toolkit centered around playing as a law enforcement/emergency services, rather than the typical FiveM RP genre (such as something that LSPDFR has tried to create). I don't actually intend to finish the entire toolkit, I only intend to challenge myself to write things that I haven't written before.

* It is very likely that this project will never be finished, as the entire purpose of the project currently is to just tinker as a hobby.
* Do __NOT__ expect to receive support for this project in a Discord, or even on this Github, as this project is not intended for widespread use.
